            Hello! I'm Suim Shin. Welcome to my homepage.<br>
            I'm currently studying Media and Communication.<br>
            I once worked part-time at a café in Australia, which gave me a broader perspective on the world.<br>
            I love traveling—so much that I try to go abroad every year!<br>
            <br>
            Since returning to Korea, I've been focusing on marketing studies,<br> and I'm also actively involved in running a student academic society.<br>
            I enjoy walking, and I absolutely adore small animals.<br>
            <br>
            My MBTI is ENFP, but I tend to be a little shy at first.<br>
            Once I get comfortable, though, I talk a lot and enjoy spending time with good people.<br>
            I truly cherish meaningful moments shared with others.<br>
            
            Achievement is one of my motivation of my life. <br><br>
           
            <br><br>
